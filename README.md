# Design
- Invoice creates at the time order completion. No action for payment here
- Receipt stores info about this payment
- ReceiptItem stores item info as InvoiceItem, but it can not be edited (simulate store in dedicate db);
- Receipt will be generated correspondingly with payment (they go along)
- Id will be generated by name and increase number for easily keep track (refer ./src/utils/index.ts);
- All amount in this system will be rounded by 2 decimals

# Assumption
- invoiceNumber and invoiceId; receiptNumber and receiptId; will be treated as the same (for reference only)
- Receipt will be generated correspondingly with payment (they go along)
- Customer can pay more at 1 time and receiving Cash back. After the invoice complete, no action can be take

# Limitation
- No transaction here

# Lib
- Joi: for validating
